# ticTacToe2ndVer
This is my second version of the classic Tic Tac Toe game.

For this version of the game, I've developed it using the tkinter library. Besides learning how to use tkinter, the main objective was to improve the user experience with a GUI.

The pending upgrades are:

1. Implement a scoreboard, in order to know who is gaining the matches.
2. Implement the code using the Pygame library in order to learn how to use it.

The images used in this program were downloaded from:
